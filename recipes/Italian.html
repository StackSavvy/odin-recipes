    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup diced pepperoni
        </li>
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.

    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until it is elastic, about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl; lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
